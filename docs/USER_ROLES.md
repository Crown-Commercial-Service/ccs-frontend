# User Roles

User roles are created and administered in WordPress using the [Members WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/).

For details about the specific user roles that exist in the CMS, please refer to the [CCS Web Docs](https://github.com/Crown-Commercial-Service/ccsweb-docs/blob/master/web/WORDPRESS_USER_ROLES.md)
