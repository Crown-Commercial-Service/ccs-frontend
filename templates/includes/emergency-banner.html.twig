                    <p class="emergency-banner-description">A worldwide IT vulnerability was discovered in Apacheâ€™s log4j product on Friday 10 December. 
                    If this is used by your IT systems you could be vulnerable to a cyber attack.
                    This is a serious issue for the government and we are working hard to make sure that any potentially vulnerable systems are protected.
