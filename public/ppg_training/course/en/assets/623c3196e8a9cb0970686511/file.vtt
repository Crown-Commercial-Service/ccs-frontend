00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.010
The Public Procurement Gateway is a new digital service

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.580
that makes buying and supplying easier for everyone.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.490
It provides a single point of entry

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.620
to our self service dashboard,

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.820
allowing you to access multiple services in one location.

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.730
You can also manage all your information

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.980
in a simple and secure way.

8
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.850
The public procurement gateway is specific to your needs.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.430
Once you've logged in, you'll find the services

10
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.500
relevant to you on your dashboard.

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.130
Every organisation needs an administrator to manage

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.320
information and authorise access for other users.

13
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.740
You can contact your administrator directly

14
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.070
to ask for access or search for your organisation

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.280
and send a request through the public procurement gateway.

16
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.330
Once approved,

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.180
you'll find the relevant services on your dashboard.

18
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.210
New services will be added as they become available.

19
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.100
Let's take a closer look.
